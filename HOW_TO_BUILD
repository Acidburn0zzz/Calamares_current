* Since august 23 2019 we're only keeping needed/specific files to build calamares, so the build process is done by PKGBUILD. makepkg is responsible to merge our config files with latest calamares source
The current PKGBUILD can be accessed at https://github.com/endeavouros-team/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/Calamares_current

Use a virtual machine or live iso

To have all functionalities be sure to install:

sudo pacman -S lsb-release cmake qt5-svg qt5-webengine yaml-cpp extra-cmake-modules boost networkmanager upower partitionmanager kcoreaddons kconfig ki18n kservice kwidgetsaddons kpmcore squashfs-tools rsync cryptsetup qt5-xmlpatterns doxygen dmidecode gptfdisk hwinfo kparts parted polkit-qt5 python qt5ct solid git qt5-tools pythonqt --needed

To use for portergos, endeavour or reborn just edit the line `branding: endeavour` accordingly at settings.conf

Keep in mind that we're trying to make it more universal for "our" 3 distros, and the build requires the script `/usr/bin/cleaner_script.sh` to detect which distro is running and run some final fixes.

Then build with:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
sudo make install

This will install files to 

/usr/bin/calamares
/usr/share/calamares
/usr/lib/calamares

Then you can run the installer with sudo calamares
